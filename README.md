# work-day-scheduler
This is my work-day scheduler project submission.

## User Story

```
As an employee with a busy schedule
I want to add important events to a daily planner
So that I can manage my time effectively
```

## Features/Expectations

This work-day scheduler features the following:

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
